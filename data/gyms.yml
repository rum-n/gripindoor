  summary: "Relatively small climbing gym with a loyal community of regulars. Lots of skilled climbers train here. Good bouldering opportunities and some climbing routes. The gym is located inside one of the giant domes of the Sofia University, which means that the walls inside are all curved. This makes for harder rope climbing routes."
